Welcome to EVA5! 

This email is to confirm your participation in EVA5. 

We wanted to share some details with you to get you started: 

**Communication:**

1.   Gmail sometimes in unreliable when sending mass emails, please make sure that **you have joined our Telegram group**: [EVA5](https://t.me/joinchat/KK7uihoWqgljKZYGZ5OABg)

2.   All future communication would be done on Telegram.

3. In case you face any problems, you can email us at [admin@theschoolofai.in](mailto:admin@theschoolofai.in)

 

**Schedule and Syllabus**

1. Your first online class is on     **12th July, Sunday at 6:45 AM** sharp. Please join early.
2. Session link will be shared     on the LMS and on the Telegram group, please join early.
3. Your syllabus is posted in     the Pages section on the LMS. 

 

**LMS**

1.   We have just sent you the LMS (learning management system) access request.

2.   Please follow the instructions as shared in the attached PDF. 

3.   Please check your SPAM folder for email from "canvas" or "instructure". 

4.   Content on the LMS is **always** posted after the class. 

5.   You will have access to the class notes covered in the class, as well as the Lecture Recording on the LMS. 

 

**Pre-requisites**

1.   As shared earlier, there are no prerequisites on the AI/ML concepts, but it is expected that you know basic Python... 

2.   To clear what basic is expected, please take a look at these two files:

1.   https://github.com/familyld/cs231n/blob/master/tutorial/python_numpy_tutorial.ipynb 

2.   https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/ 

3.   Please make sure that you understand the concepts covered in these files. Also please attempt to re-do these on [GOOGLE COLAB](https://colab.research.google.com/) 

3.   We also expect you NOT TO cover concepts on Machine Learning and CNN before attending the lecture. There is a lot of obsolete content available online, and we would strongly recommend to only cover the links/references which we will provide in the class

4.   You need a basic laptop.

5.   For Programming you'd be using https://colab.research.google.com/ so please make sure you know how to use it. 

6.   You will also be using BASIC GIT/GITHUB concepts. Please make sure you cover this [VIDEO ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)and have some knowledge. Your seniors/partners at EVA will also help you out. You need only very minimal basics of GIT. 

 

**Program Details:**

1.   **Speed:**

1.   EVA is an in-depth program, so in case you miss one session, you'll fall behind. Speed is kept medium, but if you do not follow any concept, please raise questions in the class. The classes are LIVE, which means you can ask questions. 

2.   We will do our best, but this program really would work if you ask questions and collaborate with other EVA members. 

3. Best plan for you is to not refer any online source, and limit your focus to the concepts we would cover. We really do have a plan for you! 

   

2.   **Newbies:**

1.   **If you are new to Convolutions, then it is even more important that you ask questions in the class/group.** 

2.   Make sure that you do your assignments on time. 

3.   DO NOT PROCRASTINATE (especially if you are doing this course online). If you are going to attempt the quiz/assignment on the last day, you are already doomed.

4.   We will expose a new universe for you, and make sure that you are inspired after every class to learn more. Carrying back that inspiration and converting it into working code would be your tough job

5. Do not underestimate the importance of time. You may not realize, but **1 week is ~ 2% of the year!**

   

3.   **Quiz:**

1.   **Every Session ends with an Online Quiz**. 

2.   You'll have 6 days to attempt the quiz. 

3.   Quiz is open, which means you can use Google (in vain) to search for the answers. 

4.   Quiz has negative marking

5.   Quiz is paramount in this course, and it would test you hard, so make sure you attempt it only after you have covered the concepts properly

6.   Except in the first session, we will spend the first 40 minutes on the quiz solutions

7.   You will be submitting the Quiz Solutions online on the LMS

4.   **Assignments:**

1.   **Every Session ends with an assignment** 

2.   You'll have 6.99 days to attempt the Assignment

3.   The assignment is open, which means you can use Google (in vain) to search for the solutions

4.   The assignment has negative marking (instructions would be provided, for example, -2000 points on using a Fully Connected layer, etc)

5.   The assignment is the test of your implementation skills. You are allowed to copy code from online sources for the parts you may find useful (you'll not get full code anywhere). 

6.   Comments on the Assignments will be directly provided on the LMS

7.   Every Assignment must be submitted with a well-formatted ReadMe File (will be explained in the class). 

8.   Once assignments are evaluated, best assignments would be shared with all for future reference

9.   After completing the assignment, you'll push your code to GitHub. **Please make sure you [know the basics of GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc). You'll be directly pushing your code from Google Colab to GitHub**

10. You will be submitting the **Assignment LINK** online on the LMS

    

5.   **Qualifier Project**

1.   As you already know, this is Phase 1. Session 15/16 ends with a Qualifier Project. Only if you clear Qualifier Project you'll be able to proceed to the next stage of EVA5

2.   Qualifier Projects are hard, and will really test your concepts. 

3.   Qualifier Project will take a longer time to finish, and you'll have 2 weeks. Please note that you may have to spend 6-7 days on training multiple AI models, so you'd need to start early. 

4. Qualifier Projects have hard cutoffs, and there wouldn't be any exception. 

   

6.   **Groups**

1.   It is extremely important that you form a group or be a part of a group

2.   Maximum number of people in a group of 4

3.   When submitting any assignment, you need to mention the names of your group members

4. Every session you will need to pick a group member. Your group member needs to call the other 3 members and make sure they are attending the class. If 1 person is missing while attending the class, whole group will get 50% deductions in the assignment gradings. You can of course remove a member if he/she isn't will to join the classes.

   

7.   **Welcome to an awesome journey!**

1.   We have met/seen/worked-with/had-amazing-time with more than 6500 people through EIP and EVA. 

2.   We will try our best that the next 4 month becomes one of the best learning experience you've ever had!

3.   But please remember that our role of that of a driving instructor, and **you** will have to drive the car on your own. 

4. We will only be focusing on state-of-art concepts. This helps keep the course simple, short, and concise. 

   

8.   **Next Steps:**

1.   Please cover some of the links we have provided above on Python/GitHub/Colab

2.   Please log in to your LMS. We have posted a sample Quiz, please take it to get used to the LMS and its functions.

3.   Please make sure that **you have joined your EVA5 Telegram group**: https://t.me/joinchat/KK7uihoWqgljKZYGZ5OABg

We again welcome you and thank you for deciding to spend your next 125 days with us! 

 

We will try our best to make this an amazing journey!

 

Warm Regards
